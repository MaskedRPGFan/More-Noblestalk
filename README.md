## FAQ

### Installation/Updating/Uninstallation?

Anytime. This mod leaves nothing in the save.

### Why more [Noblestalk](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Noblestalk)?

Its larger quantities will be needed to strengthen and create equipment in my mods like [Unique Gear - Titanstring](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1261).

### Is a long rest required to add new items to vendors if the addon was installed mid playthrough?

Yes.
